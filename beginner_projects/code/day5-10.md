## Day 6: Functions, Code Blocks and While Loops
**Aim:** Karel the Robot - Escaping the Maze Game (Reeborg's World)

Built-in Functions: Pre-made tools like `print()`, `len()` .   

### Key Concepts
### Functions
| Concept              | Explanation                                  | Code Example                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Function Definition  | Use `def` to create functions               | `def my_function():`             |
| Calling Functions    | Execute with `()` without `print`           | `my_function()`                  |
| Code Blocks          | Indentation (4 spaces/tabs) is crucial      | PEP 8 Standard                   |

### While Loops

The loop that will continue going while a particular condition is true. They will continue running until my condition goes WRONG.



| Concept              | Explanation                                  | Code Example                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Basic While Loop     | Runs while condition is True                | `while not at_goal():`           |
| Infinite Loops       | Avoid with proper exit conditions           | `while True: break`              |
| Negation Syntax      | `while not` vs `while !=`                   | `while at_goal() != True:  #Less Pythonic                                         while not at_goal(): #Preferred ` |
| Loop Control         | Use conditions to control flow              | `if wall_in_front(): jump()`     |

ðŸš¨ **Common Pitfalls**
- Forgetting to call functions (missing `()`)
- Infinite loops from missing exit condition
- Mixing `while not` vs `!= True` syntaxes

## Reeborg's World Projects

### Basic Movement Functions
```python
def turn_around():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def square():
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()
```

### Functions - For - While:

-Use for when you know iteration count. For loops is nicer when u want to iterate over sth and you need to do sth with each
thing that u are iterating over.

-Use while when dependent on dynamic conditions

-If we want to make our own function, start with a keyword called: def 

-If your func is not running because probably forgot to execute the function


### Maze Project

```python

# follow the right edge
# if the right side is clear continue going on right side
# when the right is not clear go straight
# if you cant go right or straight then turn left


def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()


while not at_goal():
    if not wall_on_right():  # if it can turn right
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():  # going straight ahead if it cant turn right
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()

# there might be infinite loop
# debugging the programm
# turn here 50. videos after day 15

## Day 7: Hangman Game - Functions, Lists, and Game Logic
**Aim:** Build a complete Hangman game using Python fundamentals

### Key Concepts Learned
### Core Programming Concepts
| Concept              | Implementation                          | Example Code                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Random Selection     | Choose random word from list           | `random.choice(word_list)`       |
| String Manipulation  | Create placeholders with `_`           | `"_" * len(chosen_word)`         |
| User Input           | Case-insensitive input handling        | `input().lower()`                |
| Conditional Logic    | Check letter matches                   | `if letter == guess:`            |
| Game State Tracking  | Win/lose conditions                    | `if "_" not in display:`         |

### Advanced Techniques
| Concept              | Implementation                          | Example Code                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ASCII Art            | Visual hangman stages                  | Multi-line strings with `'''`    |
| Life System          | Decrement counter for wrong guesses    | `lives -= 1`                     |
| Import System        | Modular code organization              | `#import hangman_art, #word_list=hangman_words.word_list, # from hangman_words import word_list, # from hangman_art import stages, logo`             |
| State Preservation   | Remember correct guesses               | `correct_letters.append(guess)`  |

ðŸš¨ **Debugging Challenges Overcome**
- Infinite loop prevention with `game_over` flag
- Case sensitivity issues (`lower()` conversion)
- Duplicate guess handling
- Life counter synchronization with ASCII art

### Hangman Project
```python
import random
import hangman_words
import hangman_art
# TODO-1: - Update the word list to use the 'word_list' from hangman_words.py
word_list=hangman_words.word_list
# from hangman_words import word_list
# from hangman_art import stages, logo

lives = 6

# TODO-3: - Import the logo from hangman_art.py and print it at the start of the game.
print(hangman_art.logo)

chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
print(chosen_word)

placeholder = ""
word_length = len(chosen_word)
for position in range(word_length):
    placeholder += "_"
print("Word to guess: " + placeholder)

game_over = False
correct_letters = []

while not game_over:

    # TODO-6: - Update the code below to tell the user how many lives they have left.
    print(f"****************************{lives}/6 LIVES LEFT****************************")
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()

    # TODO-4: - If the user has entered a letter they've already guessed, print the letter and let them know.

    display = ""

    if guess in chosen_word:
        print(f"You've already guessed: {guess}")

    for letter in chosen_word:
        if letter == guess:
            display += letter
            correct_letters.append(guess)
        elif letter in correct_letters: #bir Ã¶nceki ifte tuttuÄŸu memoryi bana verir
            display += letter
        else:
            display += "_"

    print("Word to guess: " + display)


    # TODO-5: - If the letter is not in the chosen_word, print out the letter and let them know it's not in the word.
    #  e.g. You guessed d, that's not in the word. You lose a life.

    if guess not in chosen_word:
        lives -= 1
        print(f"You guessed {guess}, that's not in the word. You lose a life.")

        if lives == 0:
            game_over = True

            # TODO 7: - Update the print statement below to give the user the correct word they were trying to guess.
            print(f"IT WAS {chosen_word}!\n***********************YOU LOSE**********************")

    if "_" not in display:
        game_over = True
        print("****************************YOU WIN****************************")

    # TODO-2: - Update the code below to use the stages List from the file hangman_art.py
    print(hangman_art.stages[lives])
```
