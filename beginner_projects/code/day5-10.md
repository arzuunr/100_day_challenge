## Day 6: Functions, Code Blocks and While Loops
**Aim:** Karel the Robot - Escaping the Maze Game (Reeborg's World)

Built-in Functions: Pre-made tools like `print()`, `len()` .   

### Key Concepts
### Functions
| Concept              | Explanation                                  | Code Example                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Function Definition  | Use `def` to create functions               | `def my_function():`             |
| Calling Functions    | Execute with `()` without `print`           | `my_function()`                  |
| Code Blocks          | Indentation (4 spaces/tabs) is crucial      | PEP 8 Standard                   |

### While Loops

The loop that will continue going while a particular condition is true. They will continue running until my condition goes WRONG.



| Concept              | Explanation                                  | Code Example                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Basic While Loop     | Runs while condition is True                | `while not at_goal():`           |
| Infinite Loops       | Avoid with proper exit conditions           | `while True: break`              |
| Negation Syntax      | `while not` vs `while !=`                   | `while at_goal() != True:  #Less Pythonic                                         while not at_goal(): #Preferred ` |
| Loop Control         | Use conditions to control flow              | `if wall_in_front(): jump()`     |

ðŸš¨ **Common Pitfalls**
- Forgetting to call functions (missing `()`)
- Infinite loops from missing exit condition
- Mixing `while not` vs `!= True` syntaxes

## Reeborg's World Projects

### Basic Movement Functions
```python
def turn_around():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def square():
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()
```

### Functions - For - While:

-Use for when you know iteration count. For loops is nicer when u want to iterate over sth and you need to do sth with each
thing that u are iterating over.

-Use while when dependent on dynamic conditions

-If we want to make our own function, start with a keyword called: def 

-If your func is not running because probably forgot to execute the function


### Maze Project

```python

# follow the right edge
# if the right side is clear continue going on right side
# when the right is not clear go straight
# if you cant go right or straight then turn left


def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()


while not at_goal():
    if not wall_on_right():  # if it can turn right
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():  # going straight ahead if it cant turn right
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()

# there might be infinite loop
# debugging the programm
# turn here 50. videos after day 15

```
