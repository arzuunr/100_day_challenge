## Day 12: Namespaces and Scope - Number Guessing Project

Namespaces are anything you named and they have their own scope local or global.

Python does not have block scope.

This means that variables created nested in other blocks of code e.g. for loops, if statements, while loops etc. don't get local scope.

They are given function scope if they are within a function or global scope if they are not.

**Global constants**

Something well know and you probably never gonna change than you can use it!

If you are not gonna modify it easily then as a programmer you have to write it PI, GOOGLE_URL

```python
game_level=10
enemies=["Skeleton","Zombie","Alien"]

def create_new_enemy():
    global enemies #*** #dont try to use global scope in your local func it could cause bugs lott
    new_enemy=""
    if game_level<12:
        new_enemy=enemies[0]

    print(new_enemy)

#accesible anywhere
my_global_var = 1


def my_function():
    # Only accessible within my_function()
    my_local_var = 2

def increase_enemies():
    return enemies + 1


enemies=increase_enemies()
print(f"enemies outside function: {enemies}")
```

### Prime Number Checking Project
```python
def is_prime(num):
    # kendisi ve 1 dışında bir şeye tam bölünemez
    if num > 0 and num % 2 != 0:
        for i in range(3, num + 1, 2):
            if num % i != 0:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        # we are talking about even numbers

    if num == 1:
        return False

    if num == 2:
        return True

    else:
        return False

```

## Day 13: Debugging

**Grace Brewster Hopper** was an American computer scientist, mathematician, and United States Navy rear admiral. She was a pioneer of computer programming.

Hopper was involved in the creation of UNIVAC, the first all-electronic digital computer. She invented the first computer compiler, a program that translates written instructions into codes that computers read directly. This work led her to co-develop the COBOL, one of the earliest standardized computer languages.

Also she claimed "bug" term.

Everyone get bugs!

```python
#1- Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
#  What is the for loop doing?
#  When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#  What are your assumptions about the value of i?

#2- Reproduce the Bug

#3- Play as Computer

#4- Fix the Errors
#!!!exception block
try:
    age = int(input("How old are you?"))
except ValueError:
    print("You have typed in an invalid number. Please try again with a numerical response such as 15.")
    age = int(input("How old are you?")) #careful write again this means after getting error it can work out again

if age > 18:
    print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")

#twelve
#ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'twelve'

#5- Print is your bff


#take a break
#ask a friend;google, chatgpt
#run often from the beginning
#ask stack overflow
