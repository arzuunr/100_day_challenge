## Day 16: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

_Procedural Programming_ where we set up procedures or functions that do particular things.

We can set a larget task into smaller pieces

Each of those pieces can be worked on by separate teams, separate people, and also each of these become reusable if we need the same functionality in the future.

### 2 Main Things in an Object

-attributes (has) : variable I is_holding_plate=True tables_responsable=[4,5,6] I

-methods (does) :  functions I def take_order(table, order) def tale_payment(amount): I

In Object Oriented Programming we are trying to model real life objects and those objects have things (attributes) and they also can do things (methods)
